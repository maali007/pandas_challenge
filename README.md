PART 2: Determine number of unique items, total revenue, number of purchases, and average price. Displayed in dataframe (part2_df).
PART 3: Determined gender distribution by count and percent. Displayed in dataframe (part3_df).
PART 4: Determined purchase count, average purchase price, total purchase value, and total average purchase per person - all by gender. Displayed in dataframe (part4_df).
PART 5: Determined count and percentage of purchases by given age ranges. Displayed in dataframe (part5_df). Will fix formatting of counts to remove $ sign.
